# Automated Document Summarization using NLP

### Problem Statement:

Automated Document Summarization using NLP aims to address the challenge of efficiently summarizing large textual documents. Manual summarization of documents is time-consuming and prone to human error, hindering productivity in fields such as research, education, and information retrieval. By leveraging NLP techniques, the project seeks to automate the summarization process, extracting key information from documents and generating concise summaries, thereby improving efficiency and facilitating quicker access to relevant content.

The project focuses on developing an automated document summarization system leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 

**Key components and methodologies involved in the project are outlined below:**

1. **Framework and Model:** Developed a document summarization parser utilizing TensorFlow and the T5-small model from HuggingFace, a pre-trained model specifically designed for text summarization tasks.

2. **Data Extraction:** Extracted text data from PDF documents using the PyPdf library, facilitating the input data required for the summarization process.

3. **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluated the effectiveness of the summarization algorithm by employing metrics such as ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) and BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) scores. These metrics provide insights into the quality and accuracy of the generated summaries compared to reference summaries.

4. **A/B Testing:** Conducted A/B testing to assess the performance of the developed algorithm against other state-of-the-art summarization techniques. This comparative analysis helps in understanding the relative strengths and weaknesses of the proposed solution.

5. **Cloud Infrastructure:**

- Utilized the AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud platform for project implementation, taking advantage of its scalable and reliable infrastructure.

- Deployed the summarization model on an EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance for efficient model serving and accessibility.

### Tech Stack:

- Programming Language: Python
- Framework: TensorFlow
- Pre-trained Model: T5-small (HuggingFace)
- Text Data Extraction: PyPdf
- Cloud Platform: AWS (Amazon Web Services)

### Conclusion

The project demonstrates the potential of NLP in automating complex tasks such as document summarization, thereby enhancing productivity and facilitating quicker access to relevant information. With further refinement and integration, the developed solution holds promise in various domains requiring efficient document processing and information extraction.
